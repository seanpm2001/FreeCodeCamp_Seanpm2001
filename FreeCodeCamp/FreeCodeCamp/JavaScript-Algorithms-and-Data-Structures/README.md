# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Seanpm2001 on FreeCodeCamp

I worked on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course from 2023 May 5th to 2023 July 20th. In the beginning, work was done on and off, and several lessons were completed per day. For the rest of it, it was done consecutively, with only 1 lesson per day. The course has 113 lessons. This directory includes my answers. Remember to not cheat, and try to figure it out on your own, and only use my answers as a tool to help, **not a cheatsheet** (you will learn nothing if you cheat, and this site will be pointless for you)

### Completion

I finished this unit on 2023, July 20th. Note that I am currently still donating to FreeCodeCamp, the only reason it is asking here is because I never linked my GitHub sponsorship to my FreeCodeCamp account, mostly because I like the chime sound that is made after 3 consecutive lessons completed (or in this case, 1 course completed)

I will be continuing with the JavaScript EC6 course next.
