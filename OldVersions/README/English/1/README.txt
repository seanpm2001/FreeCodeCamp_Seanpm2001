`I started to use FreeCodeCamp to boost my programming skills on 2023, May 3rd. I started with a background on various languages, most notably HTML5, Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL. Let's see where I go from here! :)`

## [Why you should not cheat](#Why-you-should-not-cheat)

Aside from the Academic Honesty Pledge, and the fact that you won't get your certificates, there are other important reasons why you shouldn't cheat on FreeCodeCamp:

- **You won't learn anything, and your experience will be pointless:** If you cheat on FreeCodeCamp, you won't be able to learn the proper problem solving and programming skills needed for the job. You may think you can just go back and learn it all later on the same site or another site, but this most often doesn't happen.
- **You will eventually get caught, and found as a fraud:** If you manage to get all of the certificates in FreeCodeCamp through cheating, your programming job will employ methods you don't understand, and of which you won't be able to guess your way through. You will likely be ousted from your position and/or job

Do not just copy and paste my answers. Try to figure out how it is done and learn. I came to this site, as my programming skills were really lacking, and I want to improve. This site really is great, and I am pretty sure you can learn something from it as well.

## [Profile backups](#Profile-backups)

Profile backups currently aren't included, as I feel they contain sensitive information about my account.

## [Missing data](#Missing-data)

- [:octocat: `#1`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/FreeCodeCamp_Seanpm2001/issues/1/)

> It appears that I currently don't have a month worth of data on me, so it can't be uploaded here yet. I should be able to upload it in the future.

Due to a system crash on 2023 June 13th, I temporarily lost access to some of my data (~3 weeks worth) I got it back, but when copying back from my external hard drive to my backup laptop, a month worth of data didn't seem to copy. This was likely due to an error, or because it was located somewhere else. In the end, I should have my laptop back from repair in a couple weeks, so that I can confirm.
